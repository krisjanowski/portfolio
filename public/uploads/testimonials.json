      "testimonial": "I’ve known Kris for over 14 years, since we were in a band together at school—he was the bassist, main songwriter, and wrote nearly every guitar riff we played. His musical instincts were always razor-sharp, and his ear for tone and dynamics set the foundation for everything we performed. Watching him evolve into a professional mixing and mastering engineer feels like a natural progression. His dedication to sound has only deepened over the years, and his ability to bring music to life in the studio is something I’ve always respected. You’re in safe hands with Kris.",
