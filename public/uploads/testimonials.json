      "testimonial": "Working with Kris is always a refreshing experience. His production style is super creative — he’s not afraid to take risks and try unexpected ideas, and they somehow always work. We’ve collaborated on a bunch of songs, and every time he brings something unique to the table that pushes the track to a whole new level. Beyond the technical skills, he’s just a solid person to work with — chill, focused, and really tuned in to the vibe. Highly recommend him to anyone looking to make something that stands out.",
