      "content": "This week, I set out to run another time constraint experiment—just like last week's challenge, but this time with a focus on house music. The idea was simple: build a track over three separate sessions, each with a different time limit—10 minutes, 1 hour, and 1 day. I allowed myself to build on the material from each prior session, but unlike last time, the results followed a very different arc.\n\n[Check out the 3 tracks here!](https://krisjanowski.co.uk/studies/time-restricted-development-mixing-mastering-episode-two)\n\n## 10 Minutes\n\nAs expected, 10 minutes didn’t offer enough time to create anything particularly refined. I managed to sketch out a basic melodic idea and paired it with a five-note bass line. After some quick volume balancing via the channel strip faders, I tossed a limiter onto the mastering chain just to round things off.\n\nThe result was undeniably rough and uninspired—but that wasn't really the point. It served its purpose: giving me a loose sense of direction for the next phase.\n\n## 1 Hour\n\nFor the hour-long session, I made a conscious decision not to simply build on the 10-minute draft. Instead, I focused on developing a chorus section that borrowed the same five-note bass motif but introduced an entirely new arrangement. I layered in piano, pads, lead synths, and percussion—aiming for a glossy, mainstream pop feel.\n\nTo bring out the familiar pulsing quality of club and dance music, I used sidechain compression: routing the kick drum to duck both the bass and the pads, creating that classic “pumping” effect. I also added compression to the master bus for a bit more cohesion and energy.\n\nThis section had a distinctly commercial vibe—functional, catchy, and radio-ready.\n\n## 1 Day\n\nThe full-day session marked a sharp departure from the previous two. I decided to scrap the melodies from both earlier sessions and start fresh, this time shaping the track into a more atmospheric, narrative-driven house piece. Rather than sticking to a traditional verse-chorus structure, I opted for a three-part progression: beginning, middle, and end—each with its own identity.\n\nThis change in approach demanded a lot more attention to dynamics and mix detail. A significant portion of the day was spent fine-tuning automation—carefully sculpting build-ups, drops, and transitions. The track is filled with layered textures, sound effects, and creative processing using distortion, delay, and a wide palette of reverb styles.\n\nThe mastering chain was my usual go-to: subtle EQ, compression, and a limiter to keep things tight but dynamic.\n\nThat said, working within a time limit had its drawbacks. I spent several hours auditioning sounds and tweaking synth parameters—trying to carve out something unique. Ironically, I ended up scrapping most of those carefully crafted patches. Despite all the tweaking, they just didn’t sit right in the mix. In the end, I went with more straightforward, preset-based sounds that better suited the mood of the track. Sometimes the simplest choice is the right one.\n\n## Reflections\n\nAll things considered, I’m fairly happy with how the track turned out, though I know it still has untapped potential. Compared to last week's experiment, this session felt more fragmented. Each stage had its own distinct direction, rather than building organically from the previous one. That lack of continuity made it harder to lock into a creative flow, and I definitely spent more time second-guessing my choices.\n\nStill, it was a valuable exercise. It reminded me how important it is to balance spontaneity with a clear plan—especially when the clock is ticking. While the final product isn’t as cohesive as I’d like, it taught me a lot about adapting under pressure and making the most of limited time, even when inspiration doesn’t strike in a straight line.\n\n[Check out the 3 tracks here!](https://krisjanowski.co.uk/studies/time-restricted-development-mixing-mastering-episode-two)",

      "summary": "In this blog post, I revisit my time constraint music challenge—this time with a focus on house music. Over three sessions (10 minutes, 1 hour, and 1 day), I set out to build a full track, allowing each phase to evolve from or diverge from the last. The result was very different from my first experiment. The 10-minute draft gave me a rough starting point; the hour-long session shifted toward a pop-inspired chorus; and the final day was spent crafting a completely new house track with dynamic structure, layered automation, and textured sound design. While I faced creative detours and scrapped a lot of the synth work along the way, the process revealed how time pressure can both fuel and fragment creativity. This challenge taught me just how crucial it is to have a plan—and when to abandon it.",

      "content": "Recently, I set myself a creative challenge: to write, produce, mix, and master a piece of music under three strict time constraints—10 minutes, 1 hour, and 1 day. Each session built on the last, forming a kind of accelerated evolution of a track. The goal wasn’t perfection—it was about pressure, momentum, and seeing how my process would adapt under a ticking clock.\n\n[Check out the 3 tracks here!](https://krisjanowski.co.uk/studies/time-restricted-development-mixing-and-mastering)\n\nWhat I discovered was equal parts surprising, frustrating, and illuminating. Here’s how it played out.\n\n## 10 Minutes\n\nLet’s be real—ten minutes to create an entire track is absurd. Just choosing instruments can take that long, never mind composing, arranging, mixing, and mastering. But I dove in anyway, treating it as an exercise in instinct over polish.\n\nI ended up with about 30 seconds of music. To save time, I reached for a bass patch I already knew well and built a simple arpeggiated melody over the top. Mixing was essentially non-existent—there just wasn’t time. For mastering, I ran the stereo output through a limiter and called it done.\n\nDespite its roughness, the result had structure and a sense of direction. More importantly, it gave me a solid jumping-off point for the next phase.\n\n## 1 Hour\n\nAn hour feels like a luxury after the frenzy of a 10-minute sprint, but in music production, it’s still a tight squeeze—especially when mixing and mastering are on the checklist too.\n\nI used the time to expand on the skeleton I’d built earlier. I fleshed out melodic ideas, layered in additional instruments to create richer textures, and began mapping some basic automation—volume swells, panning movements, reverb tweaks, and flexing.\n\nWhile the mix wasn’t polished, I managed to carve out a more cohesive sonic landscape. The mastering chain was still minimal, using light EQ, compression, and a limiter to pull things together. It wasn’t studio-ready, but it was progress—and it laid the groundwork for the final session.\n\n## 1 Day\n\nFrom 3 PM Friday to 3 PM Saturday, I gave myself 24 hours to finish the track. My goal was to produce 2–3 minutes of fully mixed and mastered audio that felt complete. The process was intense, immersive, and incredibly rewarding.\n\nWhat began as an ambient, downtempo piece unexpectedly morphed into something more dynamic—a high-energy Drum & Bass section emerged organically, almost like the track had its own ideas about where it wanted to go.\n\nI dedicated time to refining the percussive elements and FX, particularly in the DnB section. As the genre name implies, drums and bass are everything. I made sure those layers hit with weight and clarity, using careful EQ, compression, and limiting to sculpt the sound. Reverb and delay sends were automated throughout to give movement and dimension.\n\nOne highlight was the vocal element. I’d originally planned to use sampled vocals but decided instead to program melodies and pair them with lyrics using an AI vocal tool. Two female voices, subtly panned apart, created a smooth stereo image and added emotional lift. A lush plate reverb gave their harmonies a dreamy depth without washing out the mix.\n\nThe final track runs about two and a half minutes. It opens with a chilled, ambient intro, transitions into an energetic Drum & Bass heart, and closes with a spacey, contemplative outro. I left just enough headroom in the mix to boost the master cleanly, peaking at -0.3dB.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThis challenge tested me, plain and simple. Working against the clock forced me to prioritise, trust my instincts, and push past my usual perfectionist tendencies. Sure, with more time I could’ve added layers, polished the mix, tested across more playback systems—but that wasn’t the point.\n\nWhat I gained was something more valuable: a deeper understanding of how I work under pressure, and proof that creativity doesn’t always need endless hours to thrive. Sometimes, a deadline is the best collaborator you could ask for.\n\n[Check out the 3 tracks here!](https://krisjanowski.co.uk/studies/time-restricted-development-mixing-and-mastering)",

      "content": "## The Secret to Pro-Level Dialogue Audio\n\nWhether you’re recording a podcast, an interview, a YouTube video, or professional voiceover, **dialogue quality can make or break the listener’s experience**.\n\nI’ve worked with dialogue and vocal production for years, and while the tools matter, it’s the techniques that truly elevate spoken-word audio.\n\nHere are my go-to tips for recording, mixing, and mastering dialogue to a professional standard.\n\n## Recording Tips: Get It Right at the Source\n\nThe biggest mistake I see? People think they can ‘fix it in the mix’. **No plugin can rescue a bad recording.**\n\n### 1. Choose the Right Microphone\n\n* **Dynamic mics** (like the Shure SM7B) are great for untreated rooms.\n* **Condenser mics** (like Audio-Technica AT2020) capture more detail, but require a quiet, treated space.\n\n### 2. Room Matters More Than Gear\n\n* Record in the quietest space possible.\n* Use curtains, duvets, or foam to reduce reflections.\n* Avoid rooms with hard walls and floors that bounce sound.\n\n### 3. Control the Proximity Effect\n\n* Keep the speaker **3–6 inches** from the mic.\n* Use a pop filter to prevent plosives (p and b sounds).\n* Don’t let speakers move around while talking — consistency is key.\n\n### 4. Record Clean and Conservatively\n\n* Set recording levels to peak at **\\-6 dBFS**.\n* Always record in **24-bit WAV** if possible.\n\n## Mixing Tips: Clarity and Warmth\n\nOnce you’ve captured a clean recording, it’s time to polish.\n\n### 1. Clean Up Background Noise\n\n* Use Logic Pro’s **Noise Gate** gently to reduce low-level hum.\n* For tougher noise, **manual editing** or dedicated tools like iZotope RX (if available) can help.\n\n### 2. EQ for Intelligibility\n\n* **High-pass filter** around 80–100 Hz to remove rumble.\n* Cut any harsh frequencies between 2–4 kHz **carefully**.\n* Add slight boost around 1.5 kHz or 3 kHz if the voice sounds dull.\n\nLogic’s **Channel EQ** is all you need here. It’s clean and surgical.\n\n### 3. Compression for Consistency\n\n* Use **Logic Pro’s Compressor** in Vintage Opto or Studio VCA mode.\n* Aim for gentle compression — **2:1 or 3:1 ratio**, 3–5 dB of gain reduction.\n* Fast attack (20–30 ms), medium release (50–100 ms) is usually a good starting point.\n\n### 4. De-essing\n\n* Logic’s **De-Esser 2** can tame sharp ‘s’ and ‘sh’ sounds.\n* Don’t overdo it — preserve natural brightness.\n\n## Mastering Tips: Broadcast-Ready Sound\n\nEven simple mastering can make dialogue sound professional and consistent across devices.\n\n### 1. Loudness Normalization\n\n* Target **\\-16 LUFS** for podcasts/video.\n* For YouTube, Spotify, and Apple standards, stay between -16 and -14 LUFS.\n\n### 2. Final EQ Polish\n\n* Logic’s **Linear Phase EQ** can add gentle air (boost around 10 kHz) without introducing phase shift.\n\n### 3. Limiting\n\n* Use Logic’s **Adaptive Limiter**.\n* Set the ceiling to **\\-1 dBFS** and apply subtle limiting to prevent clipping.\n\n## Bonus Tip: Always Listen on Multiple Devices\n\nBefore finalizing, test your mix on:\n\n* Studio monitors\n* Headphones (studio and consumer)\n* Smartphone speakers\n\nWhat sounds balanced in the studio might be bass-heavy or tinny elsewhere.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\n**Clean dialogue is a skill and an art.**\n\nIt’s not about using every plugin or chasing loudness wars. It’s about delivering clarity, warmth, and emotion that connects with the listener.\n\nIf you need help getting your dialogue or voice recordings to a professional standard — or want full mixing/mastering services for your podcast or video content — feel free to reach out via my contact page[](https://krisjanowski.co.uk/contact).\n\nYour words deserve to be heard *at their best*.\n\n\\#mixing #mastering #dialogueaudio #podcastproduction #voiceover #logicpro #audioengineering"

      "content": "## The Overlooked Factor: Your Environment\n\nWhen people think of great sound, they think of great mics, plugins, or instruments. **But the room you record in can make or break the final result.**\n\nEarly in my career, I spent years upgrading equipment without realizing that my untreated room was working against me. Once I addressed my environment, everything changed.\n\n## Why Environment Matters\n\n### Reflections and Reverb\n\nEvery room reflects sound waves. In an untreated space, reflections bounce back into the microphone, creating:\n\n* **Comb filtering** (weird phasing effects)\n* **Boxy or muddy tone**\n* **Unwanted reverb** that blurs the clarity of your recording\n\n### The Myth of 'Fixing It in the Mix'\n\nYou *can’t EQ out room reflections or phase problems*. Plugins like Logic Pro’s Channel EQ or Space Designer can shape a sound — but they can’t remove the physical effects of a bad room.\n\n## Recording Equipment: Tools That Complement the Space\n\n### Microphones\n\nYour mic choice should match both the *source* and the *environment*.\n\n* **Dynamic mics** (Shure SM7B, Electro-Voice RE20) reject more room noise — great for untreated or noisy rooms.\n* **Condenser mics** (Audio-Technica AT4050, Rode NT1-A) capture more detail — but only sound their best in treated spaces.\n\n### Interfaces and Preamps\n\nWhile a high-quality interface (like the Universal Audio Volt series or Focusrite Scarlett range) can improve conversion and preamp clarity, **it can’t compensate for poor mic technique or room acoustics**.\n\n## The Science of Reverb: Friend and Foe\n\n**Reverb adds realism and emotion** when used correctly — but it’s also the most common source of problems.\n\n### Natural Reverb\n\n* *Too much*: Makes recordings sound distant or muddy.\n* *Too little*: Can make vocals or instruments sound unnatural or sterile.\n\n### Artificial Reverb (Mixing Stage)\n\nIn Logic Pro, tools like **Space Designer** or **Chromaverb** can create lush, controlled ambiences. But these should be **added deliberately in the mix**, not baked into the recording.\n\n## Best Practices for Mastering Your Recording Space\n\n### 1. Treat Your Room\n\n* Use bass traps and broadband absorbers in corners and on reflection points.\n* If treatment isn’t an option, record near soft furnishings or hang heavy blankets.\n\n### 2. Mic Placement\n\n* Keep the mic away from walls or corners.\n* Experiment with distance and angle — small changes can have big effects.\n\n### 3. Use Temporary Fixes When Needed\n\n* For mobile setups, portable vocal booths or reflection filters can help.\n\n## Final Word\n\n**Your environment is the invisible member of your production team.**\n\nYou can have the best mic, the best plugins, and world-class mastering tools. But if the room fights against you, every mix will be a struggle.\n\nUnderstanding the interaction between space, mic, and performance is the foundation of pro-quality audio.\n\nIf you want help evaluating your space, choosing the right gear, or want me to handle mixing/mastering for your tracks or dialogue, head to my contact page[](https://krisjanowski.co.uk/contact).

      "content": "## Tools That Shape the Sound\n\nAsk any mixing engineer and they’ll tell you — tools don’t make the mixer. But the right tools, used with experience and intention, can absolutely unlock creativity and precision.\n\nOver the years, my workflow has evolved, but certain plugins have become trusted allies in helping me shape polished, professional mixes. I work entirely in **Logic Pro**, and while third-party plugins have their place, Logic’s stock tools are often more powerful than many people realize.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the plugins I reach for in almost every project:\n\n### 1. **Channel EQ (Logic Pro)**\n\nDon’t underestimate Logic’s built-in Channel EQ. It’s clean, transparent, and incredibly efficient. Whether I’m sculpting out low-end mud, controlling harshness, or enhancing presence, this EQ does the job without adding unwanted colour.\n\nFor more surgical cuts or complex frequency work, I sometimes layer **FabFilter Pro-Q 3** — still my favourite for detailed EQ shaping when absolute precision is required.\n\n### 2. **Compressor (Logic Pro)**\n\nLogic’s Compressor is criminally underrated. I often switch between its different models (Platinum Digital, Vintage FET, Studio VCA, etc.) depending on the source. The SSL-style **Vintage VCA** model is particularly good at gluing buses together in a subtle, musical way.\n\nWhen I want a more classic ‘mix glue’ vibe, I occasionally reach for **Waves SSL G-Master Buss Compressor**, though Logic’s built-in options often hold their own.\n\n### 3. **Vintage EQ Collection (Logic Pro)**\n\nLogic’s Vintage EQs (Vintage Console EQ, Vintage Graphic EQ, and Vintage Tube EQ) beautifully emulate classic hardware tone-shaping. They add character and warmth without overdoing it. I often use the **Vintage Tube EQ** to add subtle air or weight to vocals and overheads.\n\n### 4. **Space Designer & ChromaVerb (Logic Pro)**\n\nReverb can either place a track perfectly in the mix or drown it in mud. **Space Designer** remains my go-to for natural spaces, while **ChromaVerb** shines when I want something more modern or experimental.\n\nFor more lush, creative reverb textures, **Valhalla VintageVerb** remains a favourite — especially when crafting ambient depth or cinematic layers.\n\n### 5. **Tape Delay (Logic Pro)**\n\nSimple, effective, and great-sounding. Logic’s Tape Delay has been a part of my sound design since day one. Whether it’s a slapback vocal effect or tempo-synced delays to add movement, this plugin is a constant companion.\n\n### 6. **Exciter & Saturation Tools (Logic Pro)**\n\nA little harmonic enhancement can go a long way. Logic’s **Exciter** plugin lets me add subtle (or not-so-subtle) brightness and energy to elements that need to cut through the mix. \n\nFor grittier saturation or character, **Soundtoys Decapitator** is still my go-to — it adds warmth, weight, or even controlled distortion when needed.\n\n## It’s Not Just About the Tools\n\nI can’t stress this enough: **plugins are only as good as the hands using them**.\n\nMixing isn’t about stacking every plugin you own on every channel. It’s about making intentional choices that serve the song. Sometimes, less is more. Sometimes, creative rule-breaking is what makes a track come alive.\n\nMy approach is always to:\n\n**1. Listen deeply first.**\\\n**2. Understand the artist’s vision.**\\\n**3. Use tools to enhance — not overpower — the emotion of the music.**\n\n## Why This Matters in 2025\n\nThe modern listener’s expectations are high. Whether they realize it or not, they’re used to hearing polished productions with balanced frequencies, controlled dynamics, and immersive spatial depth.\n\nFor independent artists, the gap between DIY and pro-level sound can feel intimidating. My job as a mix and mastering engineer is to bridge that gap.\n\nWhether I’m using Logic’s native tools or carefully chosen third-party plugins, my goal remains the same:\n\n**To take your creative vision and make it shine with clarity, power, and emotional impact.**\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nAt the end of the day, no plugin can replace taste, experience, or the ability to serve the music. But the right tools can certainly make the journey smoother and the results more inspiring.\n\nIf you’re looking for someone who can bring both technical expertise and artistic sensitivity to your next project, feel free to [reach out](https://krisjanowski.co.uk/contact) or explore my full portfolio at [krisjanowski.co.uk](https://krisjanowski.co.uk).\n\nLet’s make something unforgettable.\n\n\\#mixing #mastering #logicpro #musicproduction #audioengineering #plugins"

      "content": "## Avoid These Pitfalls for a Better Mix\n\nEvery mixing engineer, from beginner to veteran, has fallen into at least a few of these traps. Early in my journey, I made every mistake on this list. The good news? Each one offers a learning opportunity.\n\nLet’s break them down:\n\n### 1. **Mixing Too Loud**\n\nIt’s tempting to crank up the monitors or headphones. Loud playback makes everything sound more exciting. But it’s also deceptive.\n\n**Why it’s a problem:**\n\n* Louder levels can trick your ears into thinking a mix is better balanced than it really is.\n* You’re more likely to miss subtle imbalances or overdo compression/EQ.\n\n**My tip:**\n\n* **Mix at moderate levels**. Your ears won’t fatigue as quickly, and your balance decisions will be more accurate.\n* Frequently **check your mix at low volumes** (this is how many listeners will hear it anyway).\n\n### 2. **Overprocessing**\n\nI get it — plugins are fun. With so many powerful tools available (especially inside Logic Pro), it’s easy to throw everything at a mix.\n\n**Why it’s a problem:**\n\n* Stacking too many EQs, compressors, and effects can strip away the life of a performance.\n* Instead of clarity, you get mud or harshness.\n\n**My tip:**\n\n* Always ask yourself: *What’s the purpose of this plugin?* If you can’t answer clearly, it probably doesn’t need to be there.\n* **Less is often more**.\n\n### 3. **Neglecting Reference Tracks**\n\nMixing in isolation can be dangerous. Without context, it’s easy to lose perspective.\n\n**Why it’s a problem:**\n\n* You might unintentionally create a mix that’s too bright, too dark, or too narrow compared to industry standards.\n\n**My tip:**\n\n* Pick **2 to 3 professionally mixed tracks** in the same genre as your project.\n* Regularly **A/B compare** to stay grounded.\n\n### 4. **Ignoring Phase Issues**\n\nPhase problems can turn a potentially great mix into a hollow, weak mess — especially with multi-mic setups (like drum kits or layered guitars).\n\n**Why it’s a problem:**\n\n* Phase cancellation can suck out low-end power and stereo width.\n\n**My tip:**\n\n* **Check phase alignment early**, especially when combining multiple mics or layering similar sounds.\n* Logic Pro’s **Direction Mixer** and **Gain plugin with phase invert** can be your best friends here.\n\n### 5. **Forgetting the Listener’s Experience**\n\nIn the pursuit of technical perfection, it’s easy to forget what really matters: *how the music makes the listener feel*.\n\n**Why it’s a problem:**\n\n* You might end up chasing a perfect-looking frequency curve or stereo spread that sacrifices emotional impact.\n\n**My tip:**\n\n* Regularly step back and listen like a fan, not an engineer.\n* Ask: *Does this mix convey the feeling the artist intended?*\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nMixing is as much about psychology as it is about sound. It’s a balance between knowing the technical principles and trusting your instincts.\n\nEven the best engineers make mistakes — the key is to **recognise them early and correct course**.\n\nIf you’re an artist or producer looking for a partner who brings both precision and musicality to every project, feel free to explore my work at [krisjanowski.co.uk](https://krisjanowski.co.uk).\n\nLet’s make music that not only sounds great, but *feels unforgettable*.\n\n\\#mixing #mastering #musicproduction #audioengineering #logicpro #mixingtips"

      "content": "## The Unsung Heroes of Music Production\n\nWe live in an age of *abundance*. Every day, over **100,000 new songs** are uploaded to streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and SoundCloud. For independent artists, that’s both exciting and terrifying. The gatekeepers are gone — anyone can release music. But that also means standing out is harder than ever.\n\nHere’s the truth I’ve learned from years of production work...\n\n**Great songwriting opens the door. Professional mixing and mastering keep people listening.**\n\n## The Listener’s First Impression (It’s Faster Than You Think)\n\nIn the days of vinyl and CDs, people listened with patience. Today, algorithms drive the experience. Whether someone hears your track via a curated playlist or a TikTok clip, you often have *5 to 10 seconds* to make an impact.\n\nIf a song sounds muddy, flat, or unbalanced, most listeners won’t give it a second chance — no matter how brilliant the lyrics or melody might be.\n\n## What Mixing Really Does (Beyond Faders and EQ)\n\nTo the casual listener, mixing might seem like a technical chore: adjust the volume levels, pan things left and right, maybe add a little reverb. But a professional mix does much more:\n\n**1. Creates clarity and space** — so every element can be heard without fighting for attention.\\\n**2. Enhances emotional flow** — guiding the listener’s experience from intro to outro.\\\n**3. Translates across systems** — making sure the track sounds great on earbuds, cars, home speakers, and club systems.  \n\nMixing isn’t just a process. It’s **storytelling with sound**.\n\n## The Final Polish: Why Mastering Still Matters\n\nSome believe mastering is outdated in the streaming era. I couldn’t disagree more.\n\nMastering gives your track:\n\n**1. Competitive loudness** without sacrificing dynamic range.\\\n**2. Consistency** across an entire EP or album.\\\n**3. Compliance** with streaming platform standards (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, etc.).\n\nWithout mastering, even a beautifully mixed track can feel lacklustre or get buried when played next to other songs in a playlist.\n\n## Why It’s Even More Crucial for Independent Artists\n\nMajor labels hire entire teams to handle production, mixing, mastering, and A&R feedback. Independent artists often wear many hats themselves.\n\nThat’s where I come in. My goal isn’t just to make tracks sound professional. It’s to **level the playing field**. A well-mixed, well-mastered song can:\n\n**Hold its own against chart-topping hits.**\n\n**Catch the ear of playlist curators and sync supervisors.**\n\n**Turn casual listeners into lifelong fans.**\n\nIn a world where audiences have endless choices, polished production is more than a luxury. It’s your ticket to being taken seriously.\n\n## My Approach: Bridging Art and Science\n\nEvery artist’s vision is unique. That’s why I avoid cookie-cutter solutions. My workflow combines:\n\n**Scientific precision** — informed by my background in Neuroscience and years of training.\\\n**Creative intuition** — honed through solo projects, collaborations, and formal education in music production.\n\nWhether I’m working on a progressive metal anthem or a delicate acoustic ballad, my priority is always the same:\n\n**Honour the artist’s voice while delivering a mix and master that will captivate listeners.**\n\n## Recent Projects That Reflect This Philosophy\n\n**Zodiac: Solstice I** — Crafting progressive pieces that maintain clarity and emotional depth across shifting dynamics and genres.\n\n**Asomatous EP** — A sonic journey where I blended complex rhythmic structures with cinematic ambience.  \n\n**Bird of Paradise (feat. Ashe O’Hara & Ania Diamond)** — Balancing soaring falsetto vocals with richly textured instrumentation.  \n\nYou can explore these and more at [krisjanowski.co.uk](https://krisjanowski.co.uk).\n\n## Conclusion: The Power of a Polished Sound\n\nMusic is emotion translated into sound. But without careful mixing and mastering, that emotion can get lost.\n\nMy mission is simple: **To ensure that every artist’s message reaches the listener with maximum impact, clarity, and beauty.**\n\nIf you’re an artist, producer, or label seeking a collaborator who brings both passion and precision to every project, let’s connect.\n\n[Visit my portfolio](https://krisjanowski.co.uk) or drop me a message.

      "content": "## From Bedroom Producer to Professional Engineer\n\nIf you had asked 12-year-old me what I wanted to be, I’d have said something between a stage performer and a musical architect — even if I didn’t yet have the words for it. My love for sound started early. I’d spend hours crafting melodies on guitar, bass and piano and turning it into layered music. What began as a hobby quickly became an obsession.\n\nBack then, I didn’t have access to high-end gear. I used whatever DAW and plugins I could get my hands on. I didn’t even know what 'mixing' or 'mastering' truly meant — I just knew that some songs sounded huge, polished, and full of life, while others felt flat or crowded. I was determined to understand why.\n\n## The Science Behind the Sound\n\nAs I grew older, I realised that technical knowledge would be as important as creativity. That’s why, alongside my growing portfolio of music projects, I chose to study **Neuroscience** at university. Some might find that an odd choice for a musician, but to me, it made perfect sense.\n\nUnderstanding how the human brain perceives sound has given me an edge in production. I gained insights into spatial perception, frequency masking, and even the psychology of musical expectation — all of which inform my mixing and mastering decisions to this day.\n\nAfter earning my BSc, I pursued a **PGCE in Secondary Chemistry**. Teaching taught me something else critical to music production: how to communicate complex ideas clearly. Whether working with artists, producers, or labels, the ability to explain my creative and technical choices has been invaluable.\n\n## Finding My True Path: Production\n\nThroughout this time, I never stopped creating. I released solo projects, collaborated with other artists, and dove into every aspect of audio production. But I always felt that the finishing stages — mixing and mastering — were where I could truly elevate a song from good to unforgettable.\n\nTo formalise my skills and connect with like-minded professionals, I enrolled in the **Master’s in Popular Music Practice (Production)** program at **BIMM London**. This immersive experience exposed me to a wide range of genres and challenged me to refine not only my technical abilities but also my artistic sensibility.\n\nWhile at BIMM, I focused heavily on:\n\n* Advanced mixing techniques for dynamic and spatial balance.\n* Mastering workflows that ensure consistency across playback systems.\n* The integration of modern tools with timeless analog sensibilities.\n\nI also completed specialised training in **Mixing and Mastering at Point Blank**, one of the UK’s leading electronic music schools. This added another layer to my approach, especially in understanding how to translate mixes effectively for streaming platforms and high-fidelity playback systems.\n\n## The Art and Science of Mixing & Mastering\n\nSome see mixing and mastering as purely technical — adjusting EQ curves, compressing tracks, applying stereo imaging. Others treat it as a mysterious art form.\n\nThe truth? It’s both.\n\nWhen I mix, I’m not just balancing frequencies or making sure the vocals sit properly. I’m telling a story. I’m asking:\n\n* What emotional journey should this song take the listener on?\n* How can I enhance the artist’s vision without overpowering it?\n* What sonic textures will make this track stand out in today’s crowded musical landscape?\n\nMastering is the final polish, but it’s also a final decision-making process. It’s where technical precision meets subjective artistry. Done right, it ensures the track is competitive yet retains its soul.\n\n## Projects I’m Proud Of\n\nOver the years, I’ve had the privilege of working on a diverse range of projects. Some of my recent highlights include:\n\n**Asomatous EP** — A progressive journey blending lush synth ambiance with polyrhythmic guitar layers and jazz inspired sounds. This project was a personal milestone in dynamic range management and intricate stereo imaging.\n\n**Bird of Paradise** **(feat. Ashe O’Hara & Ania Diamond)** — Combining soaring vocals with intricate percussion and shimmering guitar textures. The mix required delicate balancing to maintain emotional intimacy while delivering a full-spectrum sound.\n\n**Zodiac: Solstice I** — A multi-genre album crafted to musically reflect the traits and characteristics associated with each zodiac sign housed within the two annual solstices.\n\nThese projects and many others can be found on my [portfolio site](https://krisjanowski.co.uk).\n\n## Why I’m Sharing This Now\n\nFor years, mixing and mastering were my personal passion — something I did alongside other careers. But today, it’s my **primary focus and professional pursuit**. I’m seeking opportunities to:\n\n1. Collaborate with **studios, labels, and production companies**.\\\n2. Work with **independent artists** who value high-quality production.\\\n3. Join a **team environment** where I can contribute and continue learning.\n\nFreelancing has given me valuable experience, but my next goal is to work alongside other skilled engineers, producers, and creators. I believe that collaboration leads to better results and fuels creative growth.\n\n## My Promise to Clients and Collaborators\n\nWhen I take on a project, I’m not just providing a service — I’m becoming a partner in the artist’s journey. I promise:\n\n* **Technical Excellence** — Every mix and master meets the highest standards of clarity, punch, and balance.\n* **Artistic Sensitivity** — I respect and enhance the artist’s vision.\n* **Reliability** — Deadlines are met. Communication is clear. Revisions are thoughtful.\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nAs music production evolves, so do I. I continue to study new techniques, stay updated on emerging trends, and invest in cutting-edge tools. But my core mission remains unchanged:\n\n**To help artists translate their creative ideas into professional, emotionally resonant recordings that connect with listeners.**\n\nIf you’re a studio manager, producer, label representative, or independent artist interested in working together, let’s connect. You can view my portfolio at [krisjanowski.co.uk](https://krisjanowski.co.uk) or reach out directly.\n\nLet’s make some unforgettable music.\n\n\\#mixing #mastering #musicproduction #audioengineering #producerlife #londonmusic"

      "slug": "huge-sounding-drums-logic-pro",
      "summary": "In this post, I walk through how I get my programmed drums to sound massive, tight, and impactful using Logic Pro. From layering acoustic and electronic samples to sidechaining, saturation, and bussing, I share the exact techniques that helped me transform my early, flat drum mixes into punchy, modern productions. I explain how I build powerful kicks and snares using Steven Slate Drums and Logic’s Quick Sampler, how I enhance cymbals and toms with saturation, and how I balance the kit as a cohesive whole using EQ, compression, and a final FX chain on a drum bus. Whether you’re struggling with lifeless MIDI drums or just looking to add more energy to your tracks, these steps can bring your percussion to life.",
      "date": "2025-05-26T09:00:00.000Z",
      "content": "When I first started writing music around the age of 12, I was obsessed with rock and metal. I’d spend hours crafting riffs on guitar, bass, and piano, trying to turn them into full songs. But it wasn’t until four years later that I got my first audio interface — a Line 6 UX1 — that I could finally record anything properly.\n\nAt that point, I still had no clue how to make what I was recording actually sound good. The quality? Honestly, it was terrible. My guitar tones were scratchy — mostly because I was running a direct out from a Line 6 Spider III straight into the interface — and my drums were even worse. I was using a cheap electronic kit that collapsed all the parts into a single audio channel. There was no real separation, no dynamics, and certainly no punch.\n\nFast forward to today, and things have changed a lot. Most of the drums in my productions are now programmed digitally, and the quality of the samples I use is a world apart from those early recordings. Still, even with great samples, I hit a wall: the drums sounded good, but they didn’t hit right. They lacked energy, impact — what you hear in modern records that makes the beat really move you.\n\nThat’s when I started learning the techniques that made all the difference. Here’s how I approach drum production now — specifically in Logic Pro — and how I get my kits sounding full, punchy, and massive.\n\n**My Go-To: Steven Slate Drums**\n\nWhen I’m programming acoustic-style drums, my default instrument is Steven Slate Drums (SSD). It has a great interface, loads of solid samples, and a built-in mixer for combining different elements into custom kits. The MIDI programming can sound impressively realistic on its own—but with a few extra steps, it can sound huge.\n\nFirst, I always split the drum MIDI into separate tracks by kit piece. Even though SSD has its own mixer, I find it much easier and more flexible to mix using Logic’s native channel strips. This gives me full control over EQ, compression, routing, and FX.\n\n**Building a Massive Kick**\n\nMy kick workflow starts by duplicating the original MIDI part and assigning it to a second track loaded with electronic kick samples. I’ve built up a personal sample bank that I drag into Logic’s Quick Sampler. From there, I audition different kicks until I find one that complements the acoustic kick.\n\nThe goal is to layer a sub-heavy electronic kick underneath the acoustic one — adding energy and weight. I low-pass the electronic kick pretty aggressively, rolling off everything above ~200 Hz. All I really want from that layer is the deep thump.\n\nFor the acoustic kick, I preserve more of the tone and texture, only rolling off the very top end — around 13.5 kHz depending on the sample. I also add compression and side chain the acoustic kick to the electronic one, with a fast attack and release. This makes space for the electronic transient to hit first and gives the whole kick a sharp, punchy edge.\n\n**Enhancing the Snare**\n\nI use a similar technique for the snare. I layer in a subtle electronic snare sample beneath the acoustic one. The electronic snare sits much lower in the mix — just enough to add a little extra energy, but not enough to muddy the tone.\n\nAgain, I low pass the electronic snare so it doesn’t interfere with the brighter textures of the acoustic layer. The goal is to let the natural snare shine, while giving it a subtle boost in weight and presence.\n\n**Polishing the Toms and Cymbals**\n\nToms and cymbals each get their own treatment. With toms, I might dial in some subtle saturation to give them more character. Cymbals, in particular, benefit from harmonic enhancement — so I often run them through a saturator to bring out their shimmer. Logic’s built-in Phat FX plugin is one of my favourites for this.\n\n**Bussing and Master FX**\n\nOnce each element is dialled in, I route everything into a master drum bus using a summing stack. On that bus, I’ll apply a final layer of processing: typically a limiter to catch peaks, plus one more saturator to glue the kit together and add a bit of analog-style warmth.\n\n**Final Touch: Tonal Balance**\n\nEven with all the individual tweaks, what really matters is how the drums sound as a whole. Getting the tonal balance right across the full kit is essential — ensuring that the snare doesn’t overpower the cymbals, the kick cuts through without smothering everything, and the space between hits feels alive.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nIt’s been a long journey from those early days of one-channel electric kits and scratchy Spider III recordings. But every mistake taught me something, and now I feel confident that my drum programming can hold its own against professional tracks.\n\nThese techniques—layering, saturation, side chaining, and EQ sculpting — have been game changers for me. If your drums aren’t hitting the way you want them to, I hope some of these ideas help bring them to life.",
